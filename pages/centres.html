            <p>My main hobby is combat sports, I have always been passionate about these sports since I was little. I started with English boxing for 1 year at the age of 13, then I stopped for 1 year to resume with 1 year of krav-maga, but this sport did not particularly appeal to me because it was rather based on self-defense, there wasn't really a fight like in English boxing and I was really looking for a sport with a lot of excitement.</p>

            <p>The following year I redirected myself to boxing but this time on French boxing because I found it more interesting to be able to use your legs during a fight unlike English boxing where you only have the right to punches. fist. I was quite satisfied with French boxing but I found that something was still missing, I really wanted to have more mobility during fights and the only discipline that offered this diversity was MMA. So I waited 1 year to have the majority because no Colmar club accepts to train minors.</p>

                <p>A few months after my registration in September 2021, I understood that MMA was really what I was passionate about and which met all my expectations. Indeed I had to use all the members of my body (feet fists elbow shin etc) and also a mix of sports including wrestling, French boxing and English boxing.</p><br>
